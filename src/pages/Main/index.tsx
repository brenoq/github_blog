                  Programming languages all have built-in data structures, but
                  these often differ from one language to another. This article
                  attempts to list the built-in data structures available in
                  JavaScript and what properties they have. These can be used to
                  build other data structures. Wherever possible, comparisons
                  with other languages are drawn. Dynamic typing JavaScript is a
                  loosely typed and dynamic language. Variables in JavaScript
                  are not directly associated with any particular value type,
                  and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of
                  all types: let foo = 42; // foo is now a number foo = bar; //
                  foo is now a string foo = true; // foo is now a boolean
